  <h3>R Markdown</h3>
  <p>
    In a nutshell, R Markdown stands on the shoulders of knitr and Pandoc. The former executes the computer code embedded in Markdown, and converts R Markdown to Markdown. The latter renders Markdown to the output format you want (such as PDF, HTML, Word, and so on). <a href="/resources/demo.html">[Demo]</a>
